# modelf.wiki

[modelf.wiki](https://modelf.wiki) is an unofficial project to help owners of Ellipse's [New Model F](https://www.modelfkeyboards.com/store/) maintain and modify their keyboards for the next three decades:

- Give new owners simple guides to get their boards up and running by organizing and simplifying community documentation
- Map the community's Model F firmware flashing tools, documentation, and other resources
- Preserve these resources on the [Internet Archive]() so no information will be lost
